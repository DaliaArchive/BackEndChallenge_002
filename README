Ruby 2.1
PostgreSQL 9.1+

Limitations
=======================
In order to simplify implementation let us assume both players will survive
User can game with one game only
User uniqueness is simplified with saving uuid to session.
Acceptance tests are missing, because it of time limiting for task completion
